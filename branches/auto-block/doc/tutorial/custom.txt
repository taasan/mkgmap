Customising the map
===================

This section covers how to change the kind of things that the
map contains and how it looks.
There are two parts to this.
First it is possible to include or leave out any of the available
data items that are contained in {osm}.
Second the colours and appearence of the final map can be changed.
These are separate operations, so that the same map can have
the colours and icons changed, simply by using a different file.
