Making a larger map
===================

So far we have just used a small sample of map data for a local area.
If you want to create a map for a whole country or continent, then
the data has to be split up into tiles first.
There is no hard and fast rule about how large the tile is, because
it depends on the numbers of map features within the tile rather than
the area that the tile covers.
So a large well mapped city may require several tiles, whereas a
poorly mapped small country may only need one or two.

Each tile is compiled and then the whole lot is combined into
a single map.
