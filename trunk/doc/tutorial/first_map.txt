Create your first map
=====================

First you need to obtain an extract of map data.  You can do this by
going to the http://www.openstreetmap.org[OSM] website, locating an area
that you are familiar with and clicking on the +Export+ button at the
top.
It will not let you download a very large area, so zoom in and
out until you find an acceptable area that is large enough to include
a number of streets and interesting points. The tutorial
will cover making maps of complete countries later on, this is
just to get started.
You will end up with a file called +map.osm+ which you should
place in the same directory as mkgmap.jar.

Alternatively you can use josm to download a familiar area of the map.
Save it to a file called +map.osm+ in the same folder as mkgmap.jar.

.Creating the map
----
java -jar mkgmap.jar map.osm
----

You should now see a few new files have been created.
The important one for now is the one called 63240001.img.
