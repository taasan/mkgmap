=== Linux packages
If you are running Linux, then you may prefer to install java from you
systems package manager, instead of from the Java site.

The package has a name like *java-1.7.0-openjdk* on Fedora and similar
distributions; on Ubuntu, Debian and similar it has a name
like *openjdk-7-jre*

== Download mkgmap
Download +mkgmap+ from the
http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/mkgmap.html[mkgmap download site].

Unzip the file into a folder or directory, the rest of the tutorial
will assume that you are working within that directory.

The main file is called +mkgmap.jar+ which is the main part of the
program itself and the +lib+ folder that contains other parts
of the program.  It is important that the +mkgmap.jar+ and the +lib+
folder stay together: if you move one you must move the other.

There will also be +doc+ folder containing the available documentation,
and an examples folder which can be ignored.
