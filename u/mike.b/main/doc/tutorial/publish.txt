Preparing to distribute your map
================================

You may want to share you map with others.
This section shows how you prepare it so that it is
well named and doesn't clash with other maps.

--family-id::
    This is an integer that identifies a family of products.
Range: [1..9999]
Mkgmap default: 6324

--family-name::
If you build several maps, this option describes the family name of all
of your maps. Garmin will display this in the map selection screen.
Example: --family-name="OpenStreetmap mkgmap XL 2019"

--product-id::
This is an integer that identifies a product within a family.  It is
often just 1, which is the default.

--product-version::
The version of the product.  Default value is 1.

--series-name::
This name will be displayed in MapSource in the map selection drop-down.
The default is "OSM map".

--area-name::
Area name is displayed on Garmin units (or at least on eTrex) as the
second part of the mapname in the list of the individual maps.

--copyright-message=note::
Specify a copyright message for files that do not contain one.

--license-file=file::
The contents of the file will be used as licence information to
be added to the map.
