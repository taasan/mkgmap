Improving the map
=================

Once you have created a simple map, then next step is to add
some options to improve or customise the map.

Option --route::
This option adds information to the map to enable automatically
finding routes between two points.
Option --drive-on-left:::
Option --drive-on-right:::
It is a good idea to set the correct option to indicate which
side of the road traffic travels on. If you don't, then mkgmap
will guess based on the direction of roundabouts which will
often be correct, but its best to make sure.

Option --code-page=1252::
This sets the characters that can be used
